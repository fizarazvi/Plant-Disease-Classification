# Plant Leaf Disease classifier

Plant disease detection through computer vision has emerged as a transformative solution for crop management, offering automation and accuracy in identifying diseases affecting crops. Typically, symptoms of diseases manifest on plant leaves, making leaf images a primary source for detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide a rapid alternative to manual inspection, efficiently processing visual data and automatically learning relevant features for accurate disease detection. Despite the potential benefits, challenges such as variability in symptoms across species, unpredictable image characteristics, and the difficulty in delineating healthy and diseased regions persist. To address these, our research employs ResNet18, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 CNN architectures, aiming to develop robust solutions through rigorous experimentation and evaluation. By advancing agricultural practices and ensuring sustainable food production, we strive to contribute to global food security efforts.

This project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of plant diseases using three distinct datasets.
